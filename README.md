## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned
This challenge was really helpful in letting me understand the workings behind form validation. From the properly structuring my HTML, to the use of Javascript functions in validating the errors

### Continued development
Hopefully I can continue improving my skills with the things I can do with Javascript.
I have noticed also that I am getting better at media queries (although there is still room for improvement )


### Useful resources

- Claude AI proved very helpful in debugging my Javascript code.
